Experience:  The experience I have is only really from my studies at University. However, I have played football for my whole life and captained my team for the past few seasons so I very much enjoy working in a team environment with a common goal and am always out to win.
Why-join:  I really enjoy racing and am a fan of F1. I have always loved the idea of working on an F1 team and think it would be a very interesting and fun job. I think that this experience would be fantastic as I would learn lots of new skills and improve massively on my existing skills. I feel like I could learn so much and be a very good member of the team.

Experience:  I was involved in the 2018 STEM in the Pipeline competition with the objective of producing a Field Development Plan (FDP) for a fictional oil field.  My team was awarded the MER UK accolade for Maximising Economy Recovery after presenting our FDP at BPâ€™s North Sea headquarters. I attended last year and now tutor the beginner section of the 'Python Argument Clinic' course in the Glasgow University School of Physics and Astronomy.
Why-join:  As a student having only completed first year and with little involvement in student led activities, I appreciate there is a very steep learning curve ahead of me in any assigned role. The challenge is the appeal. I see this as an amazing opportunity to engage and learn from more experienced students in things such as the general development cycle, gain familiarity with and apply tools such as MATLAB, and to have an outlet to apply concepts learnt from course material.
Helpful-application:  Although I have stated here my interest in maths/programming orientated roles, I would happily take on any role within your intake e.g. chassis, aerodynamics, or even sponsorship and finance. I'd really just appreciate the opportunity to get involved!
Interview-times:  Present in Glasgow. Available for any time upon request.
Hear-about:  UGRacing's social medias (Twitter, Instagram etc)

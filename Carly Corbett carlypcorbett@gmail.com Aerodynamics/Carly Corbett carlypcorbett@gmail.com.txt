Experience:  I also competed in a very similar challenge in high school for 3 years, Land Rover 4x4 in schools challenge, in which as team manger I led my team to national finals twice. My team were regional and national winners of best engineered car 3 years in a row due to our technology and ideas. I already have in depth knowledge of all aspects to the vehicle as I helped develop a chassis, bodyshell, chose motors and wheels, as well as dealing with the financial and marketing side of the competition. 
Why-join:  I wish to pursue a career in engineering, in particular aerospace/ aero-mechanical and I feel that this would be a great way for me to learn new skills and further advance my knowledge so that I am able to get a feel for what it would be like working in this field. I really enjoyed competing in the Landrover 4x4 in schools challenge and I would love to take it to the next level by joining the racing team. I would love to meet others with similar interests and represent my fellow females in STEM.
Helpful-application:  I'm aware of the heavy workload this adds and am 100% ready to commit and put in all my efforts to help make the team a success. On my 4x4 in schools team I took charge of finance, sponsorship, marketing and writing a portfolio for the car so I'm pretty confident working in those areas also if the engineering side of the team is full.

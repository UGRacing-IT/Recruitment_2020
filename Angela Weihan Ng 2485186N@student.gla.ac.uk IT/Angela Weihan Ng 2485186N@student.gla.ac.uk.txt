Why-join:  I hope to join UGRacing to not only see the fruition of driverless vehicles, but also experience the process of putting academic knowledge into a real-life project with an ambitious end goal. Most certainly, as a second year student, I hope to learn valuable skillsets from my fellow UOG students who may have more experience than I do. Being an Arts-Science student has often taught me to look at problems from a different angle and I hope to contribute different perspectives to the team.

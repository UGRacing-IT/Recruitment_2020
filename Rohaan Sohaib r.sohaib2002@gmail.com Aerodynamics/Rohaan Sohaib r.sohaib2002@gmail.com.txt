Why-join:  I believe that it will be a great opportunity to develop myself in a professional environment. I am starting my aeronautical engineering course and I will learn many things from it that enable me to help on the team. I also have a passion in learning about how machines function and helping create beautiful machines, I have used youtube many times to scope out how certain systems work, such as F1 Vehicles. This is a great opportunity to help me get a job after my degree but also a learning curve.

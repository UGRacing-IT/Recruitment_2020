GPA: nan
Option-1:  Marketing & Media
Option-2: Sponsorship & Finance
Experience:  I have a instagram account that I keep up to date regularly.

I was also involved in The Young Enterprise Scotland scheme selling bespoke wooden items (E.g. Coasters, Chopping boards, Christmas decorations ). And I was the social media manager. 

Recently I attended an online work experience week in which employees from multi-national companies (E.g IBM, Rolls Royce) gave talks about their experiences breaking into and being involved in various industries, some of which worked in advertising.
Why-join:  In my mind, Social Media will be the at the forefront of advertising and marketing and I have ambitions of owing my own business one day. As such, doing this would help me gain vital experience at a more legitimate level than before.

I'm also eager to meet other like minded folks and hopefully make some new pals.
Helpful-application:  I don't know much about cars or engines or aerodynamics, but I like watching Top Gear and fast cars and I can identify a bad advertising campaign a mile away. Thus my nose for quality and prior experience in the field would be a valuable addition to your team.

And if nothing else, I'd like to think I'm sound and I can make a banger cup of tea, so I believe I could bring good vibes and enthusiasm to everyone.

I wrote my CV a number of months ago, therefore there my be some outdated information.
Interview-times:  In the morning on the weekends preferably between 11-2

If not, all my classes finish before 4 (except on Fridays) therefore between 4-7 Mon-Thurs would be ideal.
Hear-about:  I recieved an email about it
Applied-before:  No

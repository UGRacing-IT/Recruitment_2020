Matriculation-number: 2268680A
Degree-subject: Aeronautical Engineering 
Degree-type: 5
Study-year: MEng
GPA: 17.5
Option-1:  Aerodynamics
Option-2: Aerodynamics
Experience:  Being a 5th year aeronautical engineering student I have diverse knowledge when it comes to aerodynamics. Having studied CFD 4 and multiple aerodynamics research papers, I have expertise in using flow analysis software like STAR CCM+. I have also studied multiple modules in aerodynamics, therefore I believe I would be suited perfectly for the aerodynamics team. After studying aircraft design 3, I know just how vital additional devices can be for making a body more aerodynamic.
Why-join:  I would love to join UGRacing to further develop my knowledge in aerodynamics. I am very keen to apply the theoretical knowledge I have gained to real life problems. I would also like to explore how adding additional devices and the position of these devices can affect the aerodynamics of the car, especially looking into how to create a larger downforce. I would like to continue developing my already strong teamwork and communication skills in such a diverse team.
Helpful-application:  Being a competitive bicycle racer, I know how important aerodynamics are in real life situations. Knowing that every second counts in a race and always trying to get that extra performance advantage on competitors is something I am no novice to. I have made many adaptations to my bike to find the most optimal design for aerodynamics and handling capabilities. I know that this type of approach would be very beneficial to the car racing environment.

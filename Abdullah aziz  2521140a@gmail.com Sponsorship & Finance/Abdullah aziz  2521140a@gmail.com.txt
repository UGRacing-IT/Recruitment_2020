Experience:  In a young enterprise company my position was financial director, a role I chose due to my interest in business and mathematics. I made budgets for the departments of the company according to the funds and kept meticulous records of all company finances. I confidently communicated with businessmen when negotiating prices and presenting our product. 
I have a higher in Design & Manufacture and Iâ€™m sure the skills learned from it has correlations to a role in vehicle dynamics.  

Why-join:  I'm a big fan of formula one and motorsport in general and to be able to take part in a team like that would be just amazing and super fun. I'm also wanting to start up a business alongside working as a doctor in the future so any and all experience in that field (ie finance) I can get would be very beneficial for me. Not to mention i'm really competitive so competing against other unis (at SILVERSTONE!) would be AWSOME!
Helpful-application:  I am by no means the most experienced as opposed to others i'm sure are applying to be part of the team. but I would love to be involved in any capacity even if its out-with the sub-teams i applied for above. 
Interview-times:  I am available any time provided it does not clash with any of my lectures or classes. 
Hear-about:  I seen the announcement on the moodle forum page. i read it again just to make sure because i couldn't quite believe it first. 
Applied-before:  No

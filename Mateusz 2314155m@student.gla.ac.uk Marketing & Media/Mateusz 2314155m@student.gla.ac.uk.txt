Experience:  I have been working as a marketing copywriter for two months which has taught me significantly how the written skills I have gained at university can translate into the professional world of copywriting, but I know there is still much for me to learn. I have also been an administrative assistant in my father's LTD since July and have been on the Glasgow University Sociology Society committee since 2017 when I and three other students re-established the society.
Why-join:  I hope to gain a different perspective on marketing than that of my current internship to experience the differences and similarities of marketing in different fields. I understand my skill-set and know that I would be valuable to UGRacing, so I also just want to help out in whatever way I can if we can agree on a way to fit my schedule.
Helpful-application:  I am also a big F1 fan which is one of the reasons I am praticularly interested in this post.
Interview-times:  9:00 to 13:00 most days.

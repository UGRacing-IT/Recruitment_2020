Experience:  I took part in robotics workshops hosted by the National Saturday Club, where I had the amazing opportunity to design, research and build a robot with my team under a budget of Â£100. Prior to this, I took product design as a GCSE. Here I worked with a wide range of tools and materials, such as acrylic and MDF whilst learn about suitable composite materials to use when developing a project for a specified target market.
Why-join:  My career aim is to either work for Rolls Royce or Formula 1 and I believe that being a part of the UGRacing team will be a crucial step towards my goal. Not only will UGRacing help me with my future aspirations, but I am positive that I will also grow my interpersonal skills and further develop my time management.
Helpful-application:  My drive and ambition has always led me to achieving a desired outcome. With my time spent on the UGRacing team I will be able to put all of my skills to test in an environment that mimics a possible future. So I can both gain from UGRacing and give to the team.

Why-join:  I see it as an amazing opportunity to take part in a project similar to that i would expect to be a part of once i leave education and move on to a job. i also hope to be able to develop skills which will help me with my course 
 
Helpful-application:  Im very competitive and very good at working in teams. I was part of a local athletics team when i was u17 and i was anchor leg in the relay team. I also took part in american football at a junior level and my team won a scottish championship and came 5th in the country.

Matriculation-number: 2564469W
Degree-subject: Product Design Engineering
Degree-type: 1
Study-year: Engineering
GPA: nan
Option-1:  Vehicle Dynamics
Option-2: Aerodynamics
Experience:  I have no practical knowledge of dynamics and aerodynamics other than what `I have been taught at A-level physics. But as an engineering student I would say that I can absorb information very fast and learn the most important concepts required. Furthermore, I also studied Design at A-level, so I have experience in modelling, testing and iterative design.
Why-join:  I would love to be part of the UGRacing team because I am a team player with a competitive spirit, and I want to further my knowledge of mechanics. I wish to become a product designer who has the knowledge and skillset of a mechanical engineer, bridging a gap between the two disciplines which gets smaller and smaller as technology and teaching advance.
Helpful-application:  In secondary school, I was a sports leader, which involved organising sports events for younger children. This taught me the importance of clear and concise communication, which is vital in a team such as UGRacing.
Interview-times:  Anytime on the weekend, or evenings on weekdays.
Hear-about:  Freshers fair
Applied-before:  No

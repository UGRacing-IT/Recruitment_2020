Experience:  Throughout my 4-year university career I have developed several skills which would be useful within UGRacing, including skills in Engineering software such as MATLAB and Solidworks. For example, in our 2nd year Mechanical Design project I took the lead on the design development and Solidworks aspects of the project which led to a grade of an A1. 
Why-join:  Joining UGRacing will be a unique opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained throughout university to an advanced level project. I appreciate that it will be highly time consuming and hard work but will be a fulfilling experience. It will also allow me to meet and learn from like-minded people and become part of an ambitions team. Every time I have spoken to people about UGRacing they speak very highly of how interesting and enjoyable it is.
Helpful-application:  I am a very hardworking individual who works well in a team environment and will not stop working on a problem until its solved. I feel that I would fit in well at UG Racing as it is filled with like minded individuals working towards a common goal.

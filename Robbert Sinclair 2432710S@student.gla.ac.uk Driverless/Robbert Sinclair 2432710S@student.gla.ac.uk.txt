Experience:  My current experiance from software development is Python knowledge from studying CS1P in my first year in Glasgow. Since then I have used the free time that I had in the COVID 19 Pandemic to look at the many things that I can do with Python. In terms of C++, I have done some of it a few years ago but I have limited experience in it.  I do however have some experience in C through my  secondary school. I am also studying Maths as my other subject.
Why-join:  I want to join UGRacing because I want to use my coding skills to solve a real life problem. I really enjoy coding and I want to learn how to implement Machine Learning and AI. I also want to gain experience in working on a computer project in a team as my all of my previous projects have been individual projects. I want to further enrich my skills in coding and maths to get an idea of where I would want to go in a future career.

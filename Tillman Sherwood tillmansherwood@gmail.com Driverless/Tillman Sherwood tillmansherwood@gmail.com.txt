Matriculation-number: 2388925S
Degree-subject: Mechanical Engineering
Degree-type: 3
Study-year: Masters
GPA: 16.0
Option-1:  Driverless
Option-2: Unsprung Mass
Experience:  In the past, I have learned the basics of C++ required to control an Arduino and used this to create a "clap-switch" circuit using relays. This summer, I studied python and created programs such as a sudoku solver using backtracking as well as a UK Energy Grid Dashboard using python libraries like astropy, numpy and pandas. I have spent time repairing bikes at Bike For Good. I am aware that my knowledge on the relevant subjects is very limited right now, but I am eager to learn!
Why-join:  I have always wanted to join an engineering society to learn real life applications of my studies. Especially with the recent introduction of EV and Driverless, I believe that there is no engineering society as philanthropic and results-driven as UGR. I believe that I can offer a meaningful contribution while also learning and developing hard and soft skills that may benefit me my entire life, making me both a better engineer and a better critical thinker.

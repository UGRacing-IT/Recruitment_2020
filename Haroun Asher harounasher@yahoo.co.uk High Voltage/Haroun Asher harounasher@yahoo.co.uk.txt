Experience:  In my past year studying engineering I have learned a lot. Whether it was learning theory like op-amps, nodal analysis, filters and digital/analogue converters or practical lab work where critical thinking and thinking outside the box were crucial. I also do extra curricular research like how induction motors and DC motors operate as this is very interesting to me. 
Why-join:  I have always loved F1 but my love for the sport enhanced when I watched netflix's show F1 Drive to Survive. This really portrayed to me the dedication, passion and teamwork that goes into making each individual car and I would love to be apart of something like this. During my time at UGR I would definititely learn a lot which would be incredibly useful to my career goal of working in the Automotive industry. 
Helpful-application:  This summer I was the sole employee in packing and dispatch at a health clinic distributing covid kits. Being an employee in a new department meant I had to organise new procedures to make the department as efficient as possible. I developed a lot of my interpersonal skills including teamwork, being decisive and finding solutions which will definitely be useful at UGR.

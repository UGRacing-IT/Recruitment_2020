Experience:  I have extensive academic and personal experience and interest in design and aesthetics. I would consider my area of expertise to be within filmmaking and video production in general, although I am a hobbyist user of Photoshop. I have studied film at an IB level, as well as having produced films since my primary school days. Aside from this I have experience working in creative teams as the head graphics and layout designer of a school newspaper/magazine for three years, working with Photoshop.
Why-join:  I am an freshly made, but avid racing fan and I would love to have the opportunity to hone my creative skills and work with passionate individuals in an environment that I find incredibly interesting. I would hope to meet new people with similar interests, be part of an exciting team and gain valuable experience that would come from working and collaborating at this level. 
Helpful-application:  At the beginning of last year i had the idea to create a meme account as part of a guerilla marketing campaign for the school paper/magazine I mentioned earlier. The account was targeted toward the student body of aprox. 1300 pupils, but was already at around 1800 followers by the time I graduated. It generated buzz for the magazine and upped our reader count resulting in a successful marketing campaign, as well as some knowledge gained in likeable social media outreach and management.

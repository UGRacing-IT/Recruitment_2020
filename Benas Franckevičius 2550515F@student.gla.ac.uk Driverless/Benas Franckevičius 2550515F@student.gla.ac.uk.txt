Experience:  Proficiency in C#, experience in C++, Python, a little Java. I have extensive programming knowledge; I like digging down to the details and figuring out how things work at a low level.

In terms of DL and CV I am continuing to build on my self-studies, which started this summer. I start with first principles but also like to be up to date with state-of-the-art development in these study fields. I believe reading papers and understanding the implementations of key ideas helps me progress rapidly.
Why-join:  I am excited to have an opportunity to contribute to a practical project that is at the focal point of my interests. I hope to have a chance to apply my theoretical knowledge, maintain a high-quality codebase. I expect to tackle difficult challenges which should help me grow both professionally and as an individual.
Helpful-application:  I like to work in teams with a no-nonesense approach, however I am also an advocate of self-study. I like to have a clear channel of communication and in cases where I need to step up, I try my best to deliver and meet expectations.
Interview-times:  Since I will not be travelling to Glasgow this term, I am available for remote interviews before or after lectures. My timezone is GMT+3 (Lithuania)
Hear-about:  Discord, Facebook
Applied-before:  No

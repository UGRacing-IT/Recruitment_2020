Option-2: Vehicle Dynamics
Experience:  As a student of Aeronautical Engineering, I have an understanding and passion for aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics, which will give me a basic understanding of aspects related to airflow and design.  Furthermore, my roles in several societies and job as a support colleague at Dixons Carphone has developed leadership skills, and ability to work within a team.  These experiences make me a good candidate for this position, as I will ensure the work is done to a high standard in a timely manner.
Why-join:  My interest in racing started in my first year, as I have always been curious about motorsport. I started watching such events during lockdown, and this sparked a desire to help build a formula one car. I believe that UGR will allow me to learn more within this niche field, gain experience, and be part of a team which aims to build a Formula Student car. I'm very excited at the prospect of joining in order to meet like minded individuals, and learn more about the process of building a FS Car.

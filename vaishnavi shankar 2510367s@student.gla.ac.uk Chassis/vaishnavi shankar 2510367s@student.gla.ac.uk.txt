Experience:  I participated in AIAA design of a light business jet and DBF competitions where I worked as team leader. I worked mainly in manufacturing part of the aircraft prototype we built along the propulsion part of it and even working in finance area . I worked on 3Dprinting as well as selecting the light weight material for our aircraft model to enable to carry great payloads. That was one of the mission objective as well as creating a light weight body. 
I did bachelor in aerospace  and now MSc mech.
Why-join:  I wanted to gain more experience and not only that it makes me to understand even more correlation between other fields of engineering and will give me moral values such as team work and time management. I ll also learn to take up more responsibility and also develop my communicating skills with the other members of the team and listening to their ideas before coming to any conclusions. These all will therefore help me to carry out my area in to R &D side in future .
Helpful-application:  I was selected by the Indian Space Research Organization to do a project-intern. I was involved in nozzle design and analysis for small satellite thrusters. The overall experience made me more confident and deepened my thinking skills when I also had hands on experience on GSLV MKIII rocket. I even developed electro-mechanical system that are completely automated and fail-safe to ensure ignition and thus combustion of a single droplet only under micro-gravity condition at famous IIT madras.

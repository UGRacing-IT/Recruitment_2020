Matriculation-number: 2575115M
Degree-subject: Mechatronics
Degree-type: 3
Study-year: BEng
GPA: nan
Option-1:  High Voltage
Option-2: Low Voltage
Experience:  I'm a keen electronics hobbyist having built racing drones from scratch and various other electronics projects . I've custom ordered a PCB design for my Arduino ' Punch force Meter' to make it more compact and professional.  I've knowledge of programming in Câ™¯, PHP, Arduino and Java.  My drones use power electronics, brushless motors, ESCs and flight controllers so my experience and knowledge is directly relevant to working on high and low voltage components.

Why-join:  I would love to have the opportunity to work alongside others in a team and work on an engineering project in a structured environment.  I have only done relatively small projects so working on a racing car with such powerful electronic components would be an amazing opportunity for me to develop my engineering skills and also my teamwork skills. I have never had a lot of money to spend on my projects so I would love to be able to work with more costly components.
Helpful-application:  I am a highly technically minded person and would really appreciate the opportunity to work with like-minded engineers. I am passionate about power systems and electric vehicles in general which is why I chose to study for a degree in Mechatronics.  I have extensive knowledge of brushless motors and batteries which I hope may be of use to the team in creating the University racing car. 
Interview-times:  Any time except from 7th and 12th October.
Hear-about:  Online

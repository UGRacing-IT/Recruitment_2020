However, I have experience using CAD and MATLAB for university projects and in work done for JetX that would surely be useful in accelerating my integration in the team. Also, I have independently approached CFD and Star-CCM+. I am ready to learn everything about the way the Chassis/Vehicle Dynamics team operate when designing a new racecar and how they optimise the design for manufacturing.","I would like to join UGRacing because in my opinion it is the most stimulating society available to engineering students. I am a car enthusiast and a Formula 1 follower who wants to learn more about the design and manufacturing processes of these amazing machines. Therefore, I expect to acquire additional confidence and experience in using CAD and simulation softwares alongside hands-on experience in order to obtain a good preparation for future employment in industry. ","I am a very committed and organised person who can listen to more experienced members and have a positive impact to the completion of a task. I believe that UGRacing is ideal to apply the theory studied in university courses to a real world project in a challenging way, and this is what really makes me enthusiastic about the team.

My team was awarded the MER UK accolade for Maximising Economy Recovery after presenting our FDP at BP’s North Sea headquarters. I attended last year and now tutor the beginner section of the 'Python Argument Clinic' course in the Glasgow University School of Physics and Astronomy.,"As a student having only completed first year and with little involvement in student led activities, I appreciate there is a very steep learning curve ahead of me in any assigned role. The challenge is the appeal. I see this as an amazing opportunity to engage and learn from more experienced students in things such as the general development cycle, gain familiarity with and apply tools such as MATLAB, and to have an outlet to apply concepts learnt from course material.","Although I have stated here my interest in maths/programming orientated roles, I would happily take on any role within your intake e.g. chassis, aerodynamics, or even sponsorship and finance.

This role required me to be highly organised and adaptive, with many plans changing up until the last minute. Studying medicine has also helped me to develop good interpersonal and communication skills, and has also allowed me to hone my problem-solving skills. ","I think this sounds like an amazing project on a scale that I didn't even know was possible while at university. The idea of being involved in a team that builds and races a car at Silverstone just sounds incredible. I think this experience would really challenge my organisational abilities and give me the experience of working in a team much larger, with a much bigger project, than anything I've done before. ","I'm a very committed individual and will work hard to complete projects. For example, I learned keyboard for many years and achieved my grade 8. I've also got good experience working in a team, volunteering for the cub scouts and the street pastors. The latter involves me heading out onto the streets in the early hours of the morning to help the homeless and people coming out of clubs who are very drunk, which shows I'm not afraid to put myself in uncomfortable and challenging situations.

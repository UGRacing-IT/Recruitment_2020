Degree-subject: Economics
Degree-type: 3
Study-year: MA
GPA: nan
Option-1:  Sponsorship & Finance
Option-2: HR & Logistics
Experience:  Being in my 3rd year studying economics my understanding for managing and being realistic with finances is sound.  I was part of a team that took part in the Student Investor Challenge in my final year at school 
Why-join:  To be actively involved in a team that competes in a sport that I follow intensely. Being part of a racing team I think is very different from most other team sports, with there being so many subgroups within the team but all sharing the same goal of creating the fastest possible car.  Meeting & getting along with new people is huge, by learning things from them while also hopefully being able to contribute to the overall teams performance.  
Helpful-application:  Would like to emphasise my ability to communicate and get on with people, which is needed to coordinate amongst different groups of people within the team & also negotiate with external partners.   
Interview-times:  Whenever, except Monday 12pm-4pm, Tuesday 2pm-4pm, Friday 11am-1pm
Hear-about:  Chatting to Aron Petrauskas at a birthday party
Applied-before:  No

Matriculation-number: 2557543
Degree-subject: Mechanical Engineering
Degree-type: 1
Study-year: BEng
GPA: nan
Option-1:  Chassis
Option-2: Aerodynamics
Experience:  I have previously helped a team designing a car for the F1 in schools competition, while I didn't compete with them I spent a lot of time going through their designs and material choice. I also have work experience at Zotefoams, a foam manufacturing company, where I have had exposure to lots of different composite materials and their manufacturing process. Although not being car related, I have been involved in the design and testing process with a hockey stick company for the past few years.
Why-join:  Since a young age I have always watched F1, and throughout my time at school this is probably the thing that has inspired me most to become an engineer and join a formula student team.  I expect to learn a completely new skills set, from learning about new technologies and software to meeting like mined people to work in a team with.
Helpful-application:  I have had lots of experience of working within a team and leading a team, whether it be on a sports pitch, project or behind a bar. I also have direct contacts in companies such as Zotefoams and Pearson Engineering (part of the Reece Group).
Interview-times:  All evenings for the next two weeks.
Hear-about:  Website
Applied-before:  No

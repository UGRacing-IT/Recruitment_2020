Matriculation-number: 2525558B
Degree-subject: Aeronautical Engineering
Degree-type: 1
Study-year: Beng
GPA: nan
Option-1:  Aerodynamics
Option-2: Vehicle Dynamics
Experience:  I am yet to have hands on experience working with a car, but have read books such as F1 Design by David Tremayne, How to Build a Car by Adrian Newey and the Haynes manual for the 2010-2014 RB6, so I have a basic idea of how to improve a car's performance. I also have a little experience with CAD software. I am very open to learn and willing to work hard at it and dedicate time for the team's success.
Why-join:  I am passionate about F1 and love the sport, and I would very much enjoy being a part of the team. I hope that I can apply things I learn in my study of aeronautical engineering to the racing team, and likewise learn from working on the car to aid my studies. I hope to learn more about the engineering behind the car and understand it in depth, and to contribute to the teams success whilst becoming a better, more rounded engineer.
Helpful-application:  I enjoy working as a team to solve complex problems; for example in my further mathematics A-level our small class of four would get together and solve complex maths problems together on the whiteboard from various books (e.g. 'Professor Povey's Perplexing Problems' and Martin Gardener). I find working as a team rewarding as you learn from each others unique perspectives and ideas and use them to solve the problem. This collaboration I feel is essential in today's world.
Interview-times:  Anytime outside lectures.
Hear-about:  I searched to see if the university had a formula student team before applying, then signed up at the fresher's fayre.
Applied-before:  No

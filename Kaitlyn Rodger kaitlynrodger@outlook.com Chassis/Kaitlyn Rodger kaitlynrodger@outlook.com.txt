Experience:  I have great experience in teamwork such as the work I do with FemEng. As a team we are working together to encourage more women into STEM in Malawi. The engagement consists of workshops covering multiple disciplines, from basic computer programming to diagnostic biosensing to 3D printing. Not only are we delivering practical workshops we have been working to provide the locals in Malawi with an easier and cost-efficient way to produce rice. I know my communication and teamworking skills will be
Why-join:  I wish to join UGRacing as it will give me the chance to physically apply concepts that I learn in my course. I also have a passion for motorsport and want to work in the automotive industry in the near future so this would be a great opportunity to get some hands-on experience. I would like to gain more knowledge of motorsport from the experience and also meet like-minded people.
Helpful-application:  I am a registered IMechE member.

Hear-about:  A mathematics teacher at my high school told me about UGRacing and knew that I would be interested, and this is the reason why I chose to study at Glasgow. He studied Aeronautical Engineering like me along with his best friend here at Glasgow and now his best friend actually works as an engineer for Williams F1. I also heard a presentation at a fresherâ€™s event last year and I am always interested in the work that my friends are doing who are already apart of the team.

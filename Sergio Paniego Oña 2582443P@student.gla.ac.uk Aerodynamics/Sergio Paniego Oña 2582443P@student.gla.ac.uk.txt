Experience:  I attended a one week summer course of Mechanical Engineering at ICAI University in Madrid, where I learnt the basic concepts of combustion motors. We mostly focused on four-stroke motors, but also went over the basic principle of aerodyniamics of racing cars and planes. In A-Level Physics I also went over the different types of flow, and I have been learning to program in Python for 4 years in school. I have a good level in Mathematics, having achieved A* in A-Level Further Mathematics. 
Why-join:  I see UGRacing as the perfect opportunity for personal and professional growth. In joining the team I seek, apart from the inherent technical knowledge that comes along working with new concepts and software, first-hand experience in taking part in an ambitious science-based project. I look forward to developing my communication and teamwork skills, as well as introducing myself to the actual scientific working outlook.
Helpful-application:  I can speak Spanish and German, apart from English.
Interview-times:  Everyday, 17:30 - 00:00
